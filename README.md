# QCsimulator for QCP
There is an example.py file that shows an example of 
using Grover's search, methods for this are found
in the quantum_circuit.py

Testing of functions in quantum_circuit.py, quantum_gate.py, 
and sparse_matrix.py are in classes within the module testing.py


In the directory shors there is an example.py that 
shows an example use of Shor's algorithm, methods for
this are found in the classes in algorithm.py, 
second_register.py, and quantum_fourier_transform.py
