There is a example.py that shows an example of 
use of Grover's search, methods for this are found
in the quantum_circuit.py

Testing of functions in quantum_circuit.py, quantum_gate.py, 
and sparse_matrix.py are in classes within the module testing.py


In the directory shors there is a example.py that 
shows an example use of Shor's algorithm, methods for
this are found in the classes in algorithm.py, 
second_register.py, and quantum_fourier_transform.py
